# JWT Authentication Implementation Plan

## Project: Namhatta Management System
## Date: January 19, 2025 - July 19, 2025
## Status: COMPLETED

## Overview
Implementing JWT-based authentication with username/password login, role-based access control, and development bypass functionality.

## Requirements
- Username/password authentication with JWT tokens
- 3 user roles: ADMIN, OFFICE, DISTRICT_SUPERVISOR
- District-based access control (many-to-many user-district mapping)
- Single login enforcement per user
- HTTP-only cookies for token storage
- 1-hour session duration
- Strong password requirements (10+ chars, special char, number)
- Development bypass mode for easier development

## Implementation Status

## Database Schema

### New Tables:
```sql
-- Users table
users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  role ENUM('ADMIN', 'OFFICE', 'DISTRICT_SUPERVISOR') NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE
)

-- User-District mapping (many-to-many)
user_districts (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  district_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(user_id, district_id)
)

-- Active sessions (single login enforcement)
user_sessions (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  session_token VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  expires_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(user_id)
)

-- JWT blacklist
jwt_blacklist (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  token_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  expired_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
)
```

## Access Control Matrix
```
Route                    | ADMIN | OFFICE | DISTRICT_SUPERVISOR
-------------------------|-------|--------|-------------------
/api/devotees (GET)      |   ‚úì   |   ‚úì    | ‚úì (assigned districts)
/api/devotees (POST)     |   ‚úì   |   ‚úì    | ‚úì (assigned districts)
/api/devotees (PUT)      |   ‚úì   |   ‚úì    | ‚úì (assigned districts)
/api/devotees (DELETE)   |   ‚úì   |   ‚úì    | ‚úó
/api/namhattas (GET)     |   ‚úì   |   ‚úì    | ‚úì (assigned districts)
/api/namhattas (POST)    |   ‚úì   |   ‚úì    | ‚úì (assigned districts)
/api/namhattas (PUT)     |   ‚úì   |   ‚úì    | ‚úì (assigned districts)

/api/users/districts     |   ‚úì   |   ‚úì    | ‚úó
```

## Environment Configuration
```bash
# Development (no auth)
AUTHENTICATION_ENABLED=false
VITE_AUTHENTICATION_ENABLED=false

# Production (with auth)
AUTHENTICATION_ENABLED=true
VITE_AUTHENTICATION_ENABLED=true
JWT_SECRET=your-secure-secret-key
```

## Default Users
Demo users are seeded during development setup. Contact system administrator for login credentials.
